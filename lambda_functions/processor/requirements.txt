# Processor Lambda Function Dependencies
# Only processor-specific lightweight dependencies

# Note: Heavy dependencies (pandas, numpy, scipy) now come from heavy_deps_layer
# Note: Lightweight dependencies come from shared_layer:
# - python-dateutil, structlog
# Note: boto3/botocore available in Lambda runtime

# Currently no processor-specific dependencies beyond layers
